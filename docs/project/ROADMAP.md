# Roadmap (Working Draft)

> Keep this pragmatic and current. Link tickets, ADRs, and logs rather than duplicating details.

## Release Train (example)
- **M0 — Prototype spike (2–3 weeks)**: core loop playable; placeholder assets
- **M1 — MVP (4–6 weeks)**: tutorial, one complete level, basic meta loop, exports
- **M2 — Beta (4–6 weeks)**: content expansion, polish, perf pass, telemetry
- **M3 — Launch (2–4 weeks)**: store assets, trailers, build pipeline, bugfixes

_Replace with your plan; durations are placeholders._

## Now / Next / Later
- **Now (0–2 weeks):** _TODO_
- **Next (2–6 weeks):** _TODO_
- **Later (6+ weeks):** _TODO_
